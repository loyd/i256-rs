//! Signed big integer types integer type.
//!
//! This aims to have feature parity with Rust's signed
//! integer types, such as [i32][core::i32]. The documentation
//! is based off of [i32][core::i32] for each method/member.
//!
//! Rust's signed integers are guaranteed to be [`two's complement`],
//! so we guarantee the same representation internally.
//!
//! [`two's complement`]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement
//!
//! A large portion of the implementation for helper functions
//! are based off of the Rust core implementation, such as for
//! [`checked_pow`][i128::checked_pow], [`isqrt`][i128::isqrt],
//! and more. Any non-performance critical functions, or those
//! crucial to parsing or serialization ([`add`][`i256::add`],
//! [`mul`][`i256::mul`], [`div`][`i256::div`], and
//! [`sub`][`i256::sub`]), as well as their `wrapping_*`,
//! `checked_*`, `overflowing_*` and `*_wide` variants are
//! likely based on the core implementations.
