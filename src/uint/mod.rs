//! An unsigned big integer type.
//!
//! This aims to have feature parity with Rust's unsigned
//! integer types, such as [u32][core::u32]. The documentation
//! is based off of [u32][core::u32] for each method/member.
//!
//! A large portion of the implementation for helper functions
//! are based off of the Rust core implementation, such as for
//! [`checked_pow`][u128::checked_pow], [`isqrt`][u128::isqrt],
//! and more. Any non-performance critical functions, or those
//! crucial to parsing or serialization ([`add`][`u256::add`],
//! [`mul`][`u256::mul`], [`div`][`u256::div`], and
//! [`sub`][`u256::sub`]), as well as their `wrapping_*`,
//! `checked_*`, `overflowing_*` and `*_wide` variants are
//! likely based on the core implementations.
